Once you have chosen the desired camera, press the "Calibrate" button.

3. Face the 10 x 7 chessboard (calbration board) towards the camera. Move the calibration board back and forth between from close to the camera (~5 cm) to far away from the camera (~20cm).

Move the calibration board until the progress bar at the top reaches 100%.


4. Once the calibration is successful, there should be a message that says "Calibration Successful".

The calibration can fail sometimes.

Just try again until you see succeed. It is rather hard to fail the calibration multiple times in a row.
